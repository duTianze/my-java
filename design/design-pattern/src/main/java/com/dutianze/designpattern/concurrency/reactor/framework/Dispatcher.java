 * I/O processing from application specific processing. <br> Dispatcher should call the {@link
 * ChannelHandler} associated with the channel on which event occurred.
 *
 * <p>The application can customize the way in which event is dispatched such as using the reactor
 * thread to dispatch event to channels or use a worker pool to do the non I/O processing.
