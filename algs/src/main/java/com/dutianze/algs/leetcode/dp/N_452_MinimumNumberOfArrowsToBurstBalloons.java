 * <a href="https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-number-of-arrows-to-burst-balloons/">452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons</a>
 * <h2>Medium</h2>
 * <pre>
 * There are some spherical balloons taped onto a flat wall that represents the XY-plane.
 * The balloons are represented as a 2D integer array points where points[i] = [xstart, xend]
 * denotes a balloon whose horizontal diameter stretches between xstart and xend.
 * You do not know the exact y-coordinates of the balloons.
 *
 * Arrows can be shot up directly vertically (in the positive y-direction) from different points along the x-axis.
 * A balloon with xstart and xend is burst by an arrow shot at x if xstart <= x <= xend.
 * There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. A shot arrow keeps traveling up infinitely,
 * bursting any balloons in its path.
 *
 * Given the array points, return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
 * - Shoot an arrow at x = 6, bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6].
 * - Shoot an arrow at x = 11, bursting the balloons [10,16] and [7,12].
 *
 * Example 2:
 *
 * Input: points = [[1,2],[3,4],[5,6],[7,8]]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: One arrow needs to be shot for each balloon for a total of 4 arrows.
 *
 * Example 3:
 *
 * Input: points = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5]]
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The balloons can be burst by 2 arrows:
 * - Shoot an arrow at x = 2, bursting the balloons [1,2] and [2,3].
 * - Shoot an arrow at x = 4, bursting the balloons [3,4] and [4,5].
